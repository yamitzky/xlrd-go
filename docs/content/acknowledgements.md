Many thanks to John Machin for originally writing `xlrd` and supporting it for
many years before retiring. This Go port builds on that work and the original
community contributions; thank you to everyone who helped make the Python
version possible.
Many thanks as well to all contributors of `xlrd` over the years.

- This package started life as a translation from C into Python of parts of a
  utility called "xlreader" developed by David Giffin.
- OpenOffice.org has excellent documentation of the Microsoft Excel file
  formats and Compound Document file format, authored by Daniel Rentz.
  See http://sc.openoffice.org
- U+5F20 U+654F: over a decade of inspiration, support, and interesting
  decoding opportunities.
- Ksenia Marasanova: sample Macintosh and non-Latin1 files, alpha testing
- Backporting to Python 2.1 was partially funded by Journyx - provider of
  timesheet and project accounting solutions (http://journyx.com/).
- Provision of formatting information in version 0.6.1 was funded by
  Simplistix Ltd (http://www.simplistix.co.uk).

Development of this package would not have been possible without the document
OpenOffice.org's Documentation of the Microsoft Excel File Format
("OOo docs" for short). The latest version is available from OpenOffice.org in
PDF and ODT formats:
